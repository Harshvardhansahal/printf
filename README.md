# printf
# This is my own printf project. A school project.
You can use it in a similar way of the libc printf.
This ft_printf id enable with convert :
s, c, p, d, i, o, u, x, X, f, %
with flags :
\#, 0, -, +, blank, l, L, ll, hh, h, . , *
# use  it
Use make to build ftprintf_exe.
You can mofify main.c to do your owns tests.
Be aware that I only test it on UNIX system.
